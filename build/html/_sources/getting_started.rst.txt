Getting Started
===============

Several "project files" have been included in the GSEIM
distribution. In this section, we will see how to execute (run)
some of these projects and view the simulation results.

First, let us see where the project files are located.
As explained in the
`Installation Instructions <https://github.com/gseim/gseim>`_,
there are two ways to run GSEIM in linux:

- installing pre-built image: In this case, the project files are
  not available locally, and the user should therefore download the GSEIM
  ``.zip`` file and unzip it in a suitable directory.
- building from source: In this case, the project files are already
  available locally.

In either case, the user should be able to locate the directory
``/gseim-master``.
We will denote the absolute path for this directory by ``$GSEIM_MASTER``.
Note that ``$GSEIM_MASTER`` would vary from user to user, depending
on where the GSEIM zip file has been copied/unzipped.

The project files are located in
``$GSEIM_MASTER/gseim_grc/src/gseim/test_data/input/``. We will denote
the absolute path to this directory by ``$PROJ_DIR``.

Free acceleration of induction motor
====================================

- File menu :math:`\rightarrow` Open
  :math:`\rightarrow` Select the **project file**
  ``$PROJ_DIR/machines/indmc_free.grc``
  as shown below.

    :alt: open project

  The project schematic diagram will appear as shown below.

- Click on ``Generate circuit file``. This would create the **circuit file**
  ``$PROJ_DIR/machines/indmc_free.in`` which is used by the GSEIM solver
  for solving the set of ODEs associated with the project schematic.
  Notice that a separate window opens to show the progress of this step.
  If the flow graph generation is successful, **Program Completed** will
  appear at the bottom of that window. Close the window.

  Note that the circuit file (which has extension ``.in``) always gets
  created in the same directory as the project file (which has extension
  ``.grc``).

- Click on ``Run simulation``. This invokes the solver which runs the
  simulation and creates the data files as specified for this project.
  Again, a separate window opens to show the progress made by the solver.
  The data files are also created in the same directory as the ``.grc``
  file which in this case is
  ``$PROJ_DIR/machines/``.

- Click on ``View results``. The plotting GUI would show up as a separate
  application, as shown below.

- Click on ``Load File``, and select the circuit file
  ``$PROJ_DIR/machines/indmc_free.in``. The data file created by GSEIM
  for this particular project will appear as shown below. Names of the
  variables stored in the data file are listed. Select ``time`` as
  the x-axis and ``wrm`` (the angular speed of the motor) as the y-axis to
  obtain the plot shown below.

Neutral point clamped inverter
==============================

- File menu :math:`\rightarrow` Open
  :math:`\rightarrow` Select the **project file**
  ``$PROJ_DIR/dc_to_ac/npc_inverter.grc``.
  The project schematic diagram will appear as shown below.

  .. image:: npc_schematic.png

- Click on ``Generate circuit file``. After the **Program Completed** message
  appears, close the window, and click on ``Run simulation``.
  Close the window when the program is completed.

- Click on ``View results``. In the plotting GUI, click on ``Load File``,
  and select the circuit file ``$PROJ_DIR/dc_to_ac/npc_inverter.in``.
  Select ``time`` as the x-axis and ``ia`` as the y-axis to
  obtain the plot shown below.

- We can view the Fourier components of the signal ``ia`` by clicking on
  ``Fourier`` in the plotting GUI and entering values for ``tStart`` and
  ``tEnd``, as shown below. Note that the difference between ``tStart``
  and ``tEnd`` is expected to be one period of the signal being analysed.

- The Fourier components for ``ia`` will be displayed by the GUI.
